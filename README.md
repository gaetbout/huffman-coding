#  Huffman coding 

In this repository I'll try to  implement the  Huffman coding algorithm.  
This is a lossless compression algorithm.  
It author proved mathematically that it is the most efficient way to assign bits to ***single*** character.

The algorithm to  encode a string is divided in 4 main steps.   
1. Making a table of every occurences of every character
2. Sorting them from lowest highest occurences to lowest
3. Creating a tree out of those occurences by summing the two small numbers until there is only one root left
4. Writting the table made at step 3 and the string newly string encoded
